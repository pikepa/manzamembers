                                <p class="pb-2">Coming from a hectic job back in Holland (her home country), which consumed all her time, she finally found time in Borneo to explore her long lost hobbies making paintings & sculptures. Living in Sabah and exploring the underwater world inspired her and shows in a lot of her work that makes her â€œgrow wings". *</p>
                                <p class="pb-2">With a degree in In-house Architecture she loves to make objects to show around the house. One of her projects is working with paper (like old newspapers, paper pulp and paper clay) and recycled materials to create sculptures.</p>
